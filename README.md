## Predicting Time Series using Generalized Extreme Value Loss with Various KDEs

For this final project, I worked with Yongqi Ni to develop several variations of the generalized extreme value loss function [see here](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2021.3108831), with additional investigations of missing data imputation.
