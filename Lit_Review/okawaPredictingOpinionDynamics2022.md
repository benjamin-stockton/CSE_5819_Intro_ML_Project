We then approximate the evolution of individuals’ opinions by a neural network (denoted by light blue). By penalizing the loss function with the ODEs, the neural network is informed by a system of ODEs that represent the opinion dynamics models; a concept drawn from theories of sociology and social psychology. The proposed framework is further combined with a language model (colored green in Figure 1) to fuse rich side information present in natural language texts (e.g., user profile descriptions). We also utilize low-rank approximation (dark blue) by factorizing the ODE parameters to capture the cluster structure of the social interaction network.
