However, when InterpNet finally specifies the interval, it still unavoidably introduces additional noise or causes information loss, because different patients could have very different numbers of visits. Moreover, these methods usually assume that there is an expected fixed time interval. This assumption may not valid in practice due to the dynamics of diseases.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F4968335%2Fitems%2FA5ZGKTLK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22931%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Tan et al., 2020, p. 931</span>)</span>
