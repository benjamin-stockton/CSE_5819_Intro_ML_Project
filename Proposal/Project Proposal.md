NYC/Shanghai/Beijing Transit Data
Climate data - wind speed/PM2.5/precipitation
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?limitTo=datasets&q=subway](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?limitTo=datasets&q=subway) 

We might want to look at three time series jointly to see if their correlations can be used to make better predictions compared to univariate time series prediction. 

1.  Intro + background - written together (.5-.75 page)
2.  Related work - 5 papers; each find 3 interesting papers and write up two each and then choose the fifth. (1.5-2 page)
	1.  Yongqi - focus on application papers that discuss climate or transit (depending on your choice of the data set)
	2.  Ben - focus on technical papers that discuss incorporating correlations/covariates/predictors/features and multivariate outcomes.
3.  Proposed directions - Ben (1 page)
4.  Dataset preparation - Yongqi (.5-1 page)
5.  References
6.  Responsibilities

Presentation - beamer with LaTeX/Overleaf, we’ll present/record on Webex

Friday 2-3pm (Ben will send a meeting invite)
